Starting with Hemangee Kapoor on DEI activities at ACM, fun-filled, comics-based teaching (Ullas), game for teaching linked list (Sridhar Chimalakonda), AI assisted programming (Sriram Rajamani), IITM’s data science UG program at scale (Andrew Thangaraj), and many more, it was a day extremely well spent. Thank you ACM iSIGCSE!\nAnd , what a beautiful location (Manipal University Jaipur)! It is an amazing campus, reflecting the local architecture, very impressive buildings and overall infra."

    "text": "Day 2\nThe day started with Prof Smruti Sarangi talking about how he teaches Computer Architecture and why he does it the way he does it. It was an extremely informative and thought-provoking talk, and very engaging one! Hats off to him.\nThis was followed by some good paper presentations around pedagogy and course designs by Arun Raman, Neeraj Goel, Manoj Kumar Lal, and Abhijat Vichare, good ideas shared and discussed passionately!\nPost-lunch, we had a brave soul N S Kumar doing live coding on stage and showing how data structure should be taught in class! It was amazing to see what he could accomplish in 45 min session, unfazed by so many people looking at his code and pointing out issues :-)\nBrett A. Becker had an insightful talk (online) on research-driven teaching and teaching-driven research - how teachers can do research in their classroom, and bring in research into their practice. Very insightful and a must-attend session for all the teachers (do grab a copy of the recording or at least the deck!).\nThis was followed by two excellent workshops, conducted respectively by Prof. Viraj Kumar and Prof. Venkatesh Choppella. Given cricket match was pretty much a lost cause by then, we had good attendance in the workshop!\nVery action-packed day, and great learning throughout the day as expected."

    "text": "Day 3\nThe day started out with Yogesh Simmhan presenting his ideas and experiences of teaching distributed systems course and the design of the corresponding microspecialization course for AICTE. Very relevant and insightful comments and a good discussion around skills for creation vs. comprehension, a topic close to my heart. This was followed by a panel discussion on software engineering course relevance for future software development with Vinita Gera, Rajveer Singh Shekhawat , Sumitha Prashanth , Atul Kumar, Prof. Dheeraj Sanghi, and yours truly. It was a thoroughly enjoyable session well moderated by Vinita, incisive and candid comments by Prof Sanghi set the tone for passionate conversations and hopefully audience felt it was a good use of their time. More on this in a subsequent post.\nPost lunch session was focused on computation thinking in school, how to teach it and CSPathshala, and a good discussion ensued around why, what and how of CT! Very relevant and engaging conversations with R Venkatesh, Chandan Dasgupta , Meenakshi D’Souza, and Sabitha Vinod.\nI had a great discussion with a few professors who teach BSc CS at colleges around why industry discriminates against these grads even though they study the same thing as BTech folks (this spilled over from our panel discussion where this was brought up). Definitely an area for industry to look into, and I hope to do my bit to help here, more on this topic in a subsequent post.\nThis has been an awesome experience, an extreme learning dose, for me personally, and I am enthused about my research. I made many friends and hope to continue this relationship to benefit mutually and the community and make the ties stronger! I got lots of ideas on what can be done to grow the community through the interactions over these three days and I hope I can help drive some of them. Thank you ACM India and ACM iSIGCSE for a great forum, really appreciate this. COMPUTE comes to Hyderabad next year, Profs. Tilottama Goswami and Venkatesh Choppella told as at the closure."

    "text": "Research problem\nMy research examines 3 questions:\n\nWhy do new campus hires (I am calling them novice engineer) struggle and take time in understanding large products they are supposed to work on?\nHow does current undergraduate computing education prepare novice engineers for this activity?\nWhat can help novice engineers comprehend large products faster and better?\n\nMy personal observation over last several years at a large SaaS product company shows that novice engineers face a challenge when comprehending large software products. This is also borne by several research studies which show that it takes up to two years to gain mastery over a product (see Zhou and Mockus (2010) and Sim and Holt (1998)).\n\n\nResearch direction\nI am looking at three aspects of this problem and seek solutions:\n\nWhat are the challenges novice engineers face (during onboarding and after) as they comprehend? Mostly talking to these engineers as well as students in their 3rd/4th year, surveying them, etc.\nWhat courses in undergraduate CS curriculum are likely to help them? Are they doing so? This is mostly about going through various courses, what is typically covered, and see how they can help, and what gaps are apparent.\nAre there skills and approaches that can help these novice engineers comprehend better? Here my goal is to see the applicability of a systems approach to modeling software.\n\n\n\nResearch contribution\nIn SERC@IIITH, we have been applying an approach to teaching and learning algorithms that we call Algodynamics (see Choppella, Viswanath, and Kumar (2021)). The idea is that when you think of algorithms as systems, and then model them as interactive systems, you get much better understanding and insights. You can read more about it on the Algodynamics page and see some demos).\nOur hypothesis is that we can think of a software product as a system and model its behavior accordingly. My work is focused on showing how this can be done for large systems and what principles can be learned and used by novice engineers to address comprehension problem well. Of course, this also applies when they build new software systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChoppella, Venkatesh, Kasturi Viswanath, and Mrityunjay Kumar. 2021. “Algodynamics: Algorithms as Systems.” In 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), 1–9.

The problem statement comes from my personal experience of hiring and managing campus (and 1-3 years experienced) candidates and working with other managers who do so. My thesis is intended to devise a pedagogical approach to teach modeling and other skills required to address this problem, and demonstrate that such interventions can work well. We believe pedagogy of Algodynamics can be a good starting point."
